          <p>The <b>ERS Pre-Launch Data Hackathon</b> will be a remote workshop concentrated into the <b>week of 21-25 June 2021</b>. The core focus of this workshop will be on analyzing transiting exoplanet datasets from JWST, particularly how we go from pixels downloaded from the telescope to reliable time-series stellar spectra, and how we go from those time series to fitted planetary features like transmission or emission spectra. This workshop will be structured with approximately 2 hours per day of live zoom talks/tutorials and the rest of each day devoted to additional off-zoom coding or learning exercises.</p>

          <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
          All participants in the ERS Pre-Launch Data Hackathon must agree to the <a href="code-of-conduct.html">ERS Code of Conduct</a>. If you have not done so already, please confirm your commitment to this code of conduct using <a href=https://forms.gle/Eb9hnpr1MKqskVd46 target="_blank">this google form</a>.

          <h3>Data and Computing Resources</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Simulations of complete pixel-level transit datasets for all four JWST instruments (NIRISS, NIRSpec, NIRCam, MIRI) are available for download <a href=https://stsci.box.com/s/8r6kqh9m53jkwkff0scmed6zx42g307e target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>. In each case, a transit or eclipse of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b was injected into the data at the pixel level. These simulations are meant to serve as resources for learning what to expect from JWST or for developing analysis tools and pipelines.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each day of this meeting offers an optional guided tutorial on a particular set of skills. Most of these tutorials will benefit from you completing a few setup tasks before we start. Here's what you should be aware of:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Day 0 (Getting Started): </b>Following the instructions <a href=https://github.com/ers-transit/hackathon-2021-day0 target="_blank">here</a>, download an installer for Anaconda Python (if you don't already have it installed) and the tutorial directory itself.</li>
                <li><b>Day 1 (GitHub):</b> If you don't already have one, <a href=https://github.com/ target="_blank">sign up for a GitHub account</a>. They're free!

          <h3>Agenda + Meeting Logistics</h3>
          <p>The agenda for the Pre-Launch Data Hackathon is listed below. All talks and Guided Tutorials will be held over zoom, with the connection information sent out to registered participants. We have a slack workspace that will be open to all registered participants to serve as a tool for communication and conversation beyond the zoom sessions.</p>

If you are new to the community, haven’t worked much with observations of transiting exoplanets, or want a refresher on basic transiting exoplanet concepts, please join for this day. If the topics below feel too basic or too much of a review to be useful for you, please feel very free to skip! We aim for this to be a particularly friendly space for junior scientists and new community members to learn basics and ask lots of questions.</i>

                  moderated by <u>Hannah Wakeford</u>
                  <i>(30 minutes for panel)</i><br>
                  Panelists Munazza Alam, Björn Benneke, Neale Gibson, and Laura Kreidberg will share their respective approaches towards fitting light curves and handling instrument systematics.
                  Together they will comment on previously-unseen light curve plots, try to diagnose instrument systematics, explore the effects of red noise, and discuss philosophical and practical approaches.
