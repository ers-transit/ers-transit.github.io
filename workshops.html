				<h3><i>Spring 2022:</i><br>ERS Post-Launch Data Challenge #1: Simulated Data</h3>
				<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/hex-community.svg" align="top" alt="logo with cartoon people over hexagonal JWST mirror" /></span>


					<p>The Transiting Exoplanet ERS team will conduct a Data Challenge based on simulated data during the JWST commissioning period. <i>(The description below is a draft as of January 20, 2022; details will be updated soon!)</i></p>

					<h4>Goals</h4>

					The goals of this first post-launch Data Challenge are primarily to:

					<ol>
				 <li>Develop & exercise open-source tools for JWST data analysis that yield spectroscopic timeseries</li>
				 <li>Develop & exercise open-source tools for JWST data analysis that yield fitted planetary features</li>
				 <li>Perform meaningful intercomparisons of analysis tools, including those developed by STScI</li>
				 <li>Compute planetary spectra and meta-data and make available to community for retrieval studies</li>
				 <li>Generate analysis cookbooks as a practice run for the autumn deliverables</li>
				</ol>

					<p>The ERS team will deliver simulated data products and participation guidelines to the community five weeks in advance of the Data Challenge gathering, giving individuals time to generate and deliver standard outputs and predefined benchmarks for comparing tools. The event itself will be a working meeting for comparing outputs, developing code, and generating analysis cookbooks.</p>

					<h4>Key Dates</h4>

					<ul>
						<li><b>February 14, 2022:</b> Working group deliver simulated data and Data Challenge Guidelines to the community</li>
						<li><b>March 14, 2022:</b> Community returns standard outputs to the organizers</li>
						<li><b>Week of March 21:</b> 3-day working meeting (exact dates TBD)</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Two geographical locations are currently planned for the in-person component of the Data Challenge: one at JHU and one at MPIA Heidelberg.  Virtual participation will be accommodated to the greatest extent possible.  Everyone is encouraged to deliver standard outputs regardless of whether or not they wish to attend the in-person meetings.  In-person attendance will be capped at ~30 people each.  Plans are subject to change depending on Covid restrictions.  We will make every effort to ensure the safety of our in-person participants.  All attendees must be fully vaccinated and will likely be required to take rapid antigen tests each morning.</p>

					<p>Travel grants will be available for a limited number of attendees.  Requests will be made via application (TBD).</p>

						<h3>Future Workshops</h3>
						<p>We plan to hold two data challenge workshops after JWST's launch both (1) to test instrument-specific analysis and interpretation tools on end-to-end simulations of the ERS datasets and (2) to present and compare independent analyses of the actual Early Release Science observations. The dates of these meetings were planned to be tied to JWST's launch, which happened in December 2021.</p>

							<li>The <b><a href='pre-launch-hackathon.html'>ERS Pre-Launch Data Hackathon</a> (2021)</b> was held June 21-25, 2021 online, offering an opportunity for scientists to start engaging with simulated Webb transiting exoplanet data, learn from pedagogical talks on approaches to data analysis, and complete hands-on tutorials. Slides, recordings, code notebooks, and a Webb-friendly Python conda environment are all available at the above link.</li>

							<li>The <b><a href='pre-launch-theory-webbinar.html'>ERS Pre-Launch Theory Webbinar (2021)</b></a> held weekly sessions throughout July and August 2021, offering an opportunity for scientists to learn about the basic theoretical concepts necessary for interpreting Webb transiting exoplanet atmosphere observations. Descriptions of the talks are available at the above link, and tutorial materials can be accessed through the ERS team slack.
