								<h3><i>Summer 2021:</i><br>ERS Pre-Launch Data Hackathon + Theory Webbinar</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/hex-community.svg" align="top" alt="logo with cartoon people over hexagonal JWST mirror" /></span>

									<p>We are hosting a remote workshop and remote talk series centered on transiting exoplanet science with the James Webb Space Telescope for summer 2021. The events are designed both to train upcoming scientists in relevant tools and concepts and to facilitate development of new code and analyses, all in preparation for the important new lens that Webb will provide for studying exoplanet atmospheres. Although our central focus is on preparing for the expected datasets from the ERS program, we encourage broad participation from scientists throughout the exoplanet community and aim for all events to be as inclusive and welcoming as possible. <b><a href='#register'>Register below</a> by 14 May 2021!</b></p>

									</span>

									<p> Two activities will take place in summer 2021, with the dual goals of providing both pedagogical introductions for those eager to enter the field and opportunities for everyone to contribute to new or improved tools necessary for working with the ERS datasets:
										<ul>
											<li>
												The <b>ERS Pre-Launch Data Hackathon</b> will be a remote workshop concentrated into the <b>week of 21-25 June 2021</b>. The core focus of this workshop will be on analyzing transiting exoplanet datasets from JWST, particularly how we go from pixels downloaded from the telescope to reliable time-series stellar spectra, and how we go from from those time series to fitted planetary features like transmission or emission spectra. Activities will include brief science/instrument talks, coding tutorials, and collaborative development of data analysis tools and recipes. We hope pixel-level simulated transiting exoplanet datasets will be available for all four Webb instruments (NIRISS, NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI) for use in these activities. This workshop will be structured with approximately 2 hours per day of live zoom talks/tutorials and the rest of each day devoted to additional off-zoom coding or learning exercises.
											</li>

											<li>
												The <b>ERS Theory Webbinar</b> will be a remote talk series spread over the rest of the summer, starting the week of 28 June 2021 with weekly sessions; the schedule will be available under <a href='talks.html'>Talks</a>. The core focus of the talks and demos for this series will be on the theoretical framework and models that can be used to interpret transiting exoplanet datasets from JWST, particularly how we go from observe planetary features like transmission or emission spectra to the inferred properties of planetary atmospheres. Activities will include talks about the science of exoplanet atmospheres, explorations of key concepts in atmospheric physics or chemistry, demonstrations of publicly available modeling toolkits, and retrieval challenges to compare across methods. This Webb-focused webinar (“Webbinar”) will be structured as approximately 1-2 hours of talks/tutorials occurring once per week, often with additional off-zoom coding or learning exercises.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<ul>
											<li>
											 Registration is required by <b>14 May 2021</b> for the <b>ERS Pre-Launch Data Hackathon</b>.

											<li>
												Registration is suggested by <b>28 June 2021</b> for the <b>ERS Theory Webbinars</b> (= being added to the email list).

								<h3>Future Workshops</h3>
								<p>We plan to hold additional data challenge workshops after JWST's launch both (1) to test instrument-specific analysis and interpretation tools on end-to-end simulations of the ERS datasets and (2) to present and compare independent analyses of the actual Early Release Science observations. The dates of these meetings will be tied to JWST's launch, which is assumed below to be in October 2021.</p>
