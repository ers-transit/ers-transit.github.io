								<h3><i>(POSTPONED)</i><br>Exo-Webb: Pre-Launch ERS Hackathon</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/hex-community.svg" align="top" alt="logo with cartoon people over hexagonal JWST mirror" /></span>

								<p>We were planning a small training and development workshop for transiting exoplanet science with JWST, originally to be held in July 2020 at the University of Colorado in Boulder, CO, USA and at MPIA Heidelberg. Due both to the effects of COVID-19 and the associated <a href=https://www.stsci.edu/contents/news/jwst/2020/update-on-the-jwst-cycle-1-proposal-timeline>delays for JWST</a>, this workshop has been <i>postponed</i> until further notice. It seems likely the workshop may be postponed until summer 2021, but we will reach out to everyone who expressed interest with further information as soon as we have it.</p>

								<p>This workshop will center on simulated data for the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science program, with an emphasis on learning and inclusive engagement with preparing for JWST. It will include brief science talks on exoplanet atmospheres, coding tutorials, and collaborative development of tools and recipes. Everyone will be welcome to apply, whether or not you have a previous association with the ERS team.</p>

								<h3>Future Workshops</h3>
								<p>We plan to hold additional data challenge workshops after JWST's launch, both (1) to finalize instrument-specific analysis and interpretation tools and (2) to compare analyses of the actual Early Release Science observations. The dates of these meetings will be tied to JWST's launch, which was assumed below to be in March 2021 but has now been delayed.</p>
